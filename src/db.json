Alone. &#39;Cause Dad was just a shell. His perfect wife? Gone. Our perfect Mom, the perfect family... was gone. And I... I had to be... more than just a brother. I had to be a father and I had to be a mother, to keep him safe. And that wasn&#39;t fair. And I couldn&#39;t do it. And you wanna know what that was like? They killed the girl that he loved. He got possessed by Lucifer. They tortured him in Hell. And he lost his soul. His soul. All because of you. All of it was because of you. I hate you. I hate you. And I love you. &#39;Cause I can&#39;t -- I can&#39;t help it. You&#39;re my Mom. And I understand... &#39;cause I have made deals to save the ones I love more than once. I forgive you.

They want control. They want to live in a world where they can sit in some office and decide who gets to live and who gets to die. And they&#39;ve killed people. They&#39;ve killed innocent people just because they got in the way. They think the ends justify the means. But we know better. We know hunting isn&#39;t just about killing. It&#39;s about doing what&#39;s right, even when it&#39;s hard. So we go by our gut, right? We play by our own rules, and that scares them.
